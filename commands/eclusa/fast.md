<objective>
Execute a trivial task directly in the current context without spawning subagents
or generating PLAN.md files. For tasks too small to justify planning overhead:
typo fixes, config changes, small refactors, forgotten commits, simple additions.

This is NOT a replacement for /eclusa:quick — use /eclusa:quick for anything that
needs research, multi-step planning, or verification. /eclusa:fast is for tasks
you could describe in one sentence and execute in under 2 minutes.

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/eclusa/workflows/fast.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the fast workflow from @~/.claude/eclusa/workflows/fast.md end-to-end.
